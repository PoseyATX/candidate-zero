# Roadmap

Status snapshot and prioritized forward plan, written after a full
routine-maintenance pass (2026-07-17). Grounded entirely in evidence found
in this repo — code paths that are dead, fields that are written but never
read, and the project's own prior documentation (`TICKET-v0.1-modular-baseline.md`,
`ARCHITECTURE.md`, `AC1-NOTES.md`, `BALANCE-NOTES.md`). Nothing here is
invented scope; every item traces to something already scaffolded, flagged,
or discovered in the codebase.

## How to read this doc

- **Phase 0** is done — this session's maintenance pass. Listed for context.
- **Phases 1–3** are the highest-value next work: they finish systems that
  are already half-built (real bugs and inert scaffolding), not new ideas.
- **Phases 4–6** are larger, legitimately new feature/content investments.
- **Phase 7–8** are the project's own stated end goals (v0.1, Swift/iOS).
- Each item lists its evidence so a future reader (human or agent) doesn't
  have to re-derive "why does this matter."

## ✅ GitHub Pages source fixed (was the one manual action; done 2026-07-17)

Root cause was the repo's Pages **source** setting: "Deploy from a branch"
meant public traffic never routed through our `deploy.yml` at all,
regardless of how many times it "succeeded" — a separate `github-pages`-app
deployment (the legacy Jekyll pipeline) kept serving the raw, unbuilt
source instead. User switched Settings → Pages → Build and deployment →
Source → GitHub Actions; confirmed via the `/deployments` API that the
legacy pipeline stopped deploying, redeployed, and the user confirmed the
live site renders correctly. Full story (including the wrong "timing race"
theory tried first): `docs/BALANCE-NOTES.md`, 2026-07-17 entries.

## Phase 0 — Foundation pass (done, 2026-07-17)

Full detail: `docs/BALANCE-NOTES.md` (two 2026-07-17 entries), `docs/TICKET-v0.1-modular-baseline.md`.

| Fixed | Evidence |
|---|---|
| `index.html` was silently shipping the old legacy prototype, not the modular engine's UI | Missing every DOM id `src/ui/main.ts` needs; restored from commit `44dda09` |
| District `align`/`trap`/`incumbent` computed but never read — the "wrong-party TRAP" was mechanically the *easiest* district | `calendar.ts` only read `.field`; now `genBase` derives from `align`, `incumbent` penalizes `primaryWinProbability` |
| Labor (Petition Drive) vs money (Filing Fee) had a ~2.5x win-rate gap | AP-economy mismatch: petition ate ~6/8 primary weeks, fee cleared in ~1.5–2; retuned both, added a harness guardrail |
| `state.tier` never advanced — inert difficulty curve, PL20 permanently unreachable | Nothing wrote to it in production code; now derived from `getPhase(state)` per play |
| Two hand-duplicated data structures (starter deck list, persona attr bonuses) | Consolidated to single source of truth |
| Petition Drive/Filing Fee showing twice in the play menu | `listPlayableHand` now dedupes hand vs. camp-action entries |
| Three harnesses hand-duplicated engine logic instead of importing it | Converted `.mjs` → `.ts`, now import `src/engine`/`src/data` directly |
| `GameState.district`/`.genOpp`/`.rivals`/`.log` typed `any` | Tightened to real interfaces |
| Moderate/high esbuild CVE (dev-server only) via Vite 5 | Upgraded Vite 5.4→8.1, zero vulnerabilities |
| No CI gate — the index.html regression could reach the branch undetected | Added `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (typecheck + harness + build on every push/PR) |

### Phase 0b — Design-source recovery pass (done, 2026-07-17, same day)

The user shared the original design conversation, which turned out to
contain the actual archive prototype (`archive/prototype-single-file.html`,
1973 lines, 56 cards) this engine was extracted from — previously only
reachable via `git show 0d532fa:index.html`, now archived properly with
`archive/README.md` explaining its status. Full detail:
`docs/SRD-NOTES.md` (new — the closest thing to "SRD v1" that exists in
this repo, since no such document existed before despite `AGENTS.md`
calling it law).

| Done | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Persona could be silently abandoned mid-run via "New run" with no confirmation | Engine-level check confirmed `applySetup` only ever runs once (no mutation bug); added a confirm guard in the UI — covenant 7 ("Choices bind") wasn't fully enforced at the UX layer |
| Cards read as a plain list, not cards | Redesigned to 2:3 aspect ratio tiles: cost badge, tagline (surfaces the `card.tag` flavor field that existed on every card but was never rendered), risk-class color coding, camp/trap corner ribbons, layered shadows, hover lift — verified via headless screenshots at desktop and mobile widths |
| "Shadow consequences on Faces" (TICKET's stated next step) was undesigned | Turned out to be fully designed *and implemented* in the archive (`shadowCheck()`) — ported in full to `src/engine/reputation.ts`, wired into `executePlay` |
| Reputation grants (R01–R12) never fire — `resolve()` reads `hasRep(state,'R10')` etc. but nothing ever grants them | Ported the archive's `repCheck()` subset reachable with existing state (R01/R02/R04/R07/R10/R11) |
| `PL13_FishFry`'s text promises "the small-dollar list starts here" but never granted `B05` | Fixed — one missing line, found via diffing against the archive's equivalent card |
| Three files had private, duplicate `hasRep`/`warm` helpers | Consolidated into `src/engine/reputation.ts`, imported everywhere |
| Roadmap Phase 2 ("design an allies/reps system") was open-ended | Rescoped with an exact source to port from and precise remaining items — see Phase 2 below |

---

## ✅ The Chronicle — cross-run meta-progression (done, 2026-07-17)

Direct user request: a roguelike shouldn't have a hard restart on a loss —
"the player keeps moving through failure... they should keep moving and
growing until the next election cycle." Turned out this was already fully
designed and built in the archive (`LEGACY`/`TRAITS`/interim-path/
`startIncumbentRun` system) but never ported — `types.ts` even had a
`LegacyState` interface sitting there typed with `any`, unused anywhere,
same shape as `fieldAp` before this session's Phase 2 item 1 fix.

Ported to `src/engine/legacy.ts` + `src/engine/loop.ts`'s
`createIncumbentCampaign`:
- A run ending (win or loss) records an epithet + growth summary to a
  persistent "Chronicle" (`localStorage`, shown on the setup screen).
- On a loss, the player picks an interim path (Perennial Candidate /
  Advocate / Staffer / Go Home a While — gated by how the run went) and
  then a permanent trait from that path (10 archive traits ported in
  full, capped at 3 held at once) that measurably buffs every future run
  — no dead "New run" button, an actual card-pick screen.
- On a `won_general`, "Stand for Reelection" skips setup entirely and
  continues straight into the next filing period as the incumbent,
  carrying forward a discounted share of contacts/nameID/money/
  endorsePts/volPool/reps/deck (archive's exact carry-forward formulas).
- `T_NERD` trait revealed a second dead scaffold: `parlSave`/`parlUsed`
  fields existed on `GameState` (one persona already granted `parlSave`)
  but nothing ever read them — wired into `executePlay` for `PL04`
  (archive also gates `PL24`, not yet ported).
- Not ported: obligations don't carry forward on reelection (modular
  `obls` is still free-text, not the archive's structured registry —
  Phase 2 item 4), and `district.incumbent` is deliberately left `false`
  on a reelection continuation rather than mirroring the archive's flag
  literally — that flag models an *opposing* entrenched incumbent in this
  engine's probability formulas, so setting it `true` for the player's
  own seat would double-penalize them.

Verified: pure-engine checks (carry-forward math, trait cap, path
gating) plus a full Playwright pass — played a seeded run to
`missed_filing`, picked a path and trait, confirmed the Chronicle
renders and survives a page reload, then started a fresh run and
confirmed the banked-contacts trait actually applied (25 contacts at
week 1, exactly 30% of the prior run's total).

## Phase 1 — Close the gaps this pass exposed but didn't fix (near-term, low risk)

These are direct follow-ups to Phase 0 findings — verification and tooling,
not new design.

1. **Reachability check in `harness:audit`.** The audit harness
   (`src/harness/audit-srd-plays.ts`) checks catalog *shape* (id format,
   attrs, risk, phases) but not *reachability*. That's exactly the gap that
   let PL20 sit dead for an unknown number of increments — it was asserted
   present in the catalog (`harness:ac1`) but never asserted playable.
   Add a check that simulates enough of a campaign (or directly walks
   `show`/`req` gates against a matrix of representative states) to confirm
   every card can, under some real game state, actually become playable.

2. **Automated "dead reference" scan for ally/rep/asset/backer ids.** This
   pass found ~13 ids (`AL01`, `AL03`, `AL04`, `AL05`, `AL09`, `AL11`,
   `R01`, `R05`, `R06`, `R07`, `R10`, `A01`, `A09`, `B05`) referenced in
   `odds`/`run`/`req` functions across `src/data/plays.ts` that are never
   granted anywhere. Rather than re-discover this by hand next time, add a
   small script/harness that greps `warm(s,'ID')` / `hasRep(s,'ID')` /
   `s.assets.includes('ID')` / `s.backers.includes('ID')` call sites,
   collects referenced ids, and cross-checks each against every place an id
   is pushed onto `state.allies`/`.assets`/`.reps`/`.backers`. Report any id
   that's referenced but never granted. This is the same shape of bug as
   the district-trap issue (Phase 0) and `state.tier` (Phase 0) — a
   condition that can structurally never fire — so it's worth a permanent
   guardrail, not just a one-time cleanup.

3. **Grounds subsystem is half-built.** `Ground.aff` (affinity tags like
   `"O,G"`) and `Ground.gated` (only `GR04 Church Corridor` is `gated: true`)
   are populated in `createDefaultGrounds()` (`src/engine/state.ts`) but
   never read by any mechanic — no card checks affinity, nothing ever
   un-gates a gated ground. Additionally, **there is no ground-selection UI
   anywhere** (CLI or web): `pickDefaultGround` always auto-picks the first
   ground with `pool > 0`, so the 8 named grounds with distinct pool sizes
   and affinities are decorative flavor text, not a real strategic choice,
   despite the data model clearly being designed for one. Either build the
   selection UI + affinity mechanic, or (if it's genuinely out of scope for
   now) simplify the data model so it stops implying a choice that doesn't
   exist — leaving it half-wired is the same "looks real, isn't" problem
   Phase 0 fixed twice already.

4. **Archive-prototype yield parity is still open.** `docs/AC1-NOTES.md`:
   "Action yield-table full compare for archive ACTIONS (walk/fund/chairs)"
   has been open since the engine extraction. `harness:yields` only covers
   PL01/PL13/PL04. Low urgency (modular is already the declared source of
   truth), but it's the one remaining unchecked box on AC1, which gates the
   v0.1 label (Phase 7).

## Phase 2 — Allies / Assets / Reps acquisition system (rescoped 2026-07-17 — this is a port, not a design task)

**Update:** the source design conversation shared 2026-07-17 turned out to
contain the actual archive prototype this engine was extracted from
(`archive/prototype-single-file.html`), which has a complete, working
version of most of this. **The "open question" below has been answered:**
this phase is now a porting task with an exact source to port from, not a
from-scratch design task. Full detail: `docs/SRD-NOTES.md` ("Shadow
consequences + reputation grants" section).

**Already done (2026-07-17):** `src/engine/reputation.ts` ports
`shadowCheck()` in full (Faces thresholds → real consequences — this was
also TICKET's "Next: Shadow consequences on Faces", now satisfied) and the
subset of `repCheck()` reachable with existing state (R01, R02, R04, R07,
R10, R11). Also fixed one concrete bug found via the diff: `PL13_FishFry`'s
text promised "the small-dollar list starts here" but never actually
granted `B05` — now it does.

**Still open, now precisely scoped instead of open-ended:**

1. **~~Two dedicated cards~~ Done (2026-07-17):** `PL21B` "Promote a
   Canvass Captain" (`{a:1, vp:3}`, SAFE, grants `AL09`) and `PL39` "Hire a
   Field Director" (`{a:1, $:2200}`, STD, alt. paid path to `AL09`) both
   ported into `src/data/plays-wave4.ts`. This also required porting the
   archive's `fieldAp` mechanic itself (a free weekly field-ops action,
   `S.fieldAp`) which didn't exist in the modular engine at all —
   `GameState.fieldAp` was declared but dead. Now: `canAfford`/`payCost`
   (`src/engine/play.ts`) let a `card.field` play spend `state.fieldAp`
   instead of `state.ap`, and `state.fieldAp` resets to `warm(s,'AL09') ? 1
   : 0` at every week boundary (`src/engine/calendar.ts`, both the
   primary→general transition and the normal weekly advance). Every
   existing `warm(s,'AL09')` bonus in `PL01`/`PL02`/`PL04`/`PL19` is now
   reachable. Adding these two cards to the deck pool nudged the
   `harness:full` money-vs-labor guardrail from 2.3x to a documented 2.4x
   (see `src/harness/full-campaign.ts` for the dated rationale) — both
   routes to `AL09` are affordability/RNG-gated, not guaranteed, so this is
   texture, not a landslide.
2. **A purchasable assets shop:** the archive buys `A01`/`A09`/etc. with
   real costs/requirements (`archive/prototype-single-file.html:820+`);
   modular `state.assets` currently only ever receives setup-time tags.
   Needs a UI surface (a "shop" panel) as well as engine support — bigger
   than item 1.
3. **~~6–21 more personas~~ Done (2026-07-17):** ported 20 of the archive's
   21 attribute-linked personas (one skipped — name collision with the
   existing `preacher`), plus all 12 remaining issues (18 total now). Pure
   data, no new mechanics needed, so this no longer needed the "curated
   subset vs. all 21" judgment call the note below used to raise — all of
   it went in. What *is* still an open call: whether the resulting 24-persona
   roster needs its own balance pass (see Phase 5's `smallbiz` note — "more
   starting power" isn't automatically balance-neutral, and 20 new personas
   is a lot of new starting-state surface that hasn't been through
   `harness:full` individually).
4. **Obligations registry restructure:** the archive's `OBLS` are
   structured `{n, drag}` records with an ongoing *weekly* effect (e.g. a
   PAC obligation taxes `faces.L` and `exposure` every week it's held) —
   not modular's free-text `state.obls: string[]`. This changes what
   `state.obls` *is*, not just what's in it, and needs a weekly-tick call
   site. This is the mechanical "bite" for `PL20_PacCheck`'s obligation
   that Phase 3 (below) originally called for — same fix, correctly
   relocated here since it's part of the same registry-porting work as
   allies/reps, not a standalone design problem.
5. **12 more allies** (`AL02`–`AL08`, `AL10`, `AL12`–`AL16`) with no
   confirmed grant path even in the archive for several of them — would
   need either finding their grant sites (search wasn't exhaustive) or
   deliberately deferring them.

## Phase 3 — Debt has no consequence (small; rescoped 2026-07-17)

**Rescoped, smaller than originally estimated.** `state.debt`
(`PL21_SelfFundCredit`) is still recorded but never read by any mechanic.
Checking the archive for how debt "bites back" there: it doesn't tax any
win probability or trigger a repayment mechanic — its only visible
consequence is narrative, surfaced on the loss/terminal screen ("The bank
still wants its money. Losing does not cancel the note.",
`archive/prototype-single-file.html:1746`). So the honest, low-risk fix
here is much smaller than a new mechanic: surface `state.debt` (and held
obligations) in the terminal outcome text when a run ends, the way the
archive does, rather than building a debt-collection system that the
source material doesn't actually call for.

## Phase 4 — Build the Session stage

`GameState.stage` already includes `'session'`, `getPhase()` already maps
it to phase 3, and a real chunk of state exists solely for it: `capital`,
`favor`, `districtStanding`, `bill`, `committee`, `sessionFlags` — all
initialized, all completely unread by any current mechanic.
`ARCHITECTURE.md` already says the quiet part: "Session | later | 3 | Not
yet simulated." This is the game's third act (after winning the general,
you're a legislator trying to move something related to your chosen
`issue`) and is very likely the single largest remaining systems
investment in the project. **Recommend a dedicated design pass before
implementation** — this shouldn't be improvised card-by-card the way Wave
4 was; it's a new stage with its own win/loss shape, not a new wave of
cards in the existing loop.

## Phase 5 — Sweep balance breadth beyond labor/money

Phase 0 fixed the two headline strategies and one systemic district bug,
but the full setup matrix — now 24 personas × 4 districts × 7 regions × 18
issues = 12,096 combinations (was 672 before the 2026-07-17 persona/issue
port) — has only ever been spot-checked (`harness:setup` covers
teacher/open/east and veteran/gulf; `harness:full` only runs the default
setup, and none of the 20 newly-ported personas have been through it at
all). This matrix just got substantially bigger without a corresponding
increase in balance coverage — worth flagging as higher priority than it
was this morning. Things worth checking:

- **The 20 newly-ported personas**: verified mechanically correct (apply()
  effects fire, `harness` suite green) but not balance-checked individually
  — some grant `money += 2500` (`PA_DIP_CHA`) or `money += 1500` (both
  `PA_CRA_DIP` and the existing `smallbiz`), which combined with the
  filing-fee economics below could produce more degenerate-fast-money
  personas than just `smallbiz`.
- **`smallbiz` persona (+$1,500 starting money) vs. the new $1,250 filing
  fee**: this persona can now file in week 1 essentially for free. That may
  be exactly the intended identity ("everyone owes you credit or a favor")
  or it may be too strong relative to the other personas — worth a
  deliberate call, not an accident. Now shared by at least two of the
  ported personas too (see above).
- **The `wrong` district, post-Phase-0 fix**: it's now intentionally the
  hardest district (high `genBase` from `align: 'wrong'` + trap tax). Worth
  confirming via harness that it's brutal-but-winnable (a real risky
  choice) rather than an accidental soft-lock — the whole point of a
  "TRAP: bravery is not arithmetic" district is that bravery should
  *sometimes* pay off.

Recommend extending `full-campaign.ts` (or a new harness) to sample across
persona/district/region combinations and flag any combo whose win rate is
degenerate (near-0% or near-100%).

## Phase 6 — UI/UX polish

**Product thesis, stated explicitly by the project owner (2026-07-17):**
the goal is Dwarf-Fortress-level systemic complexity in a form factor
playable **one-handed on mobile with minimal navigation/scrolling** — the
card/deckbuilder structure was chosen specifically because of this
constraint, not as a genre default. This means mobile-viewport scroll
distance and tap-target ergonomics are load-bearing product requirements
here, not standard "responsive polish" — treat regressions in either as
bugs, the way `docs/BALANCE-NOTES.md`'s 2026-07-17 "Mobile card-grid bug"
entry does (a `minmax()` CSS Grid spec detail silently collapsed the
mobile card grid to one column instead of two, costing ~37% extra scroll;
fixed same day). Any future UI work should screenshot-verify at a phone
width (this session used 390×844) before considering it done, the same
way balance changes get harness-verified before considering them done.

TICKET already names general UI polish as the last gate before considering
v0.1 ("UI polish; only then consider v0.1 label with evidence bundle").

**Done in the 2026-07-17 mobile-game UI pass** (patterns borrowed from the
mobile-deckbuilder canon — persistent vitals HUD, thumb-reach primary
action, never hide the hand):

- ✅ Risk-class color coding (left border per class + risk-tinted odds
  meter fill).
- ✅ Mobile pass, screenshot-verified at 390×844: sticky compact HUD (AP
  pips, money, week + signature progress meters) pinned to the top of the
  screen while scrolling; End Week pinned to the bottom of the viewport in
  thumb reach; both hidden/normal on desktop widths.
- ✅ Full-hand visibility: cards you can't currently play render dimmed
  with the specific reason ("No AP left", "Not enough money", "Phase 2/3
  only") instead of vanishing from the list — plan-around information,
  standard in the genre. Cards gated by `show`/`req` stay hidden
  (undiscovered content, not locked options).
- ✅ Per-card success-odds meter bar (at-a-glance p%, tinted by risk).
- ✅ Fixed a fieldAp regression: with 0 AP but a field action banked, the
  UI said "No AP left — end the week" and hid the playable field card.
- ✅ `theme-color` meta + `color-scheme: dark` (mobile browser chrome
  matches the walnut theme; form controls render dark natively).

Concretely still open:

- No accessibility pass (color contrast, keyboard nav for the card grid,
  `aria-live` regions exist on log/juice but haven't been screen-reader
  tested).
- No visual regression / e2e test in CI — Phase 0 added a CI gate for
  typecheck+harness+build, but a headless click-through (the kind used to
  verify the index.html fix and the Vite 8 upgrade this session) isn't
  automated yet. Worth adding once the UI is a real target for iteration
  rather than a recently-repaired one.
- ~~Card art is still typographic-only~~ Addressed (2026-07-17, same-day
  follow-up after direct feedback that the cards hadn't visibly improved
  since the 2:3 change): every card now has a real anatomy — centered
  name banner, Art Deco hairline-and-diamond divider, an engraved emblem
  plate (24 hand-drawn lineart SVG marks in `src/ui/card-art.ts`, one
  per card: boot, rotary phone, fish, pie tin, megaphone, money bag, …)
  with a sunburst backdrop, a rotated notary-seal cost stamp with
  sub-cost tags, rubber-stamp CAMP/TRAP treatments replacing the corner
  ribbons, aged-paper grain (inline feTurbulence noise), corner
  brackets, and a ticket-stub footer with a risk-colored dot. Draft
  cards and terminal/Chronicle choice cards share the same anatomy via
  one `cardInner()` renderer. Raster/painted art per card remains the
  eventual ceiling, but the typographic-only gap is closed.
- The log panel is plain text; popular deckbuilders surface last-action
  results as transient stacked toasts. The juice banner covers the
  headline case; a fuller notification stack is future polish.

## Phase 7 — v0.1 label

Per `AGENTS.md` Covenant 8 ("Honest versioning — no marketing labels
without evidence") and TICKET's own AC6 ("Not v0.1 — package `0.0.1`"),
this should only happen once AC1–AC5 have full recorded evidence *and*
Phase 6 (UI polish) is done. Phase 0 closed one real AC1/AC2-relevant gap
(PL20 was failing AC2's implicit "every catalog card is real" bar) and
hardened the audit tooling's honesty; Phase 1 item 1 (reachability
checking) is the natural way to make AC2 evidence trustworthy going
forward rather than re-discovered by accident.

## Phase 8 — Swift / iOS port

The stated long-term shipping target (`ARCHITECTURE.md`: "Long-term
shipping target remains native Swift / iOS"; `AGENTS.md`: "Do not
implement a second rules engine in Unity; TS (then Swift) owns mechanics").
Not started, and shouldn't be until the engine is stable enough that a port
isn't chasing a moving target — i.e., realistically after Phases 1–4 land,
since Phase 2–4 all touch `GameState`'s shape. One concrete thing Phase 0
already did in this direction: tightening `district`/`genOpp`/`rivals`/`log`
from `any` to real interfaces. A cleanly-typed TS `GameState` maps far more
directly onto Swift structs/enums than one full of `any` — worth continuing
that discipline as new fields are added (Phase 2–4 will add several).

---

## Standing practices (to prevent this list from needing a "round 3")

These aren't roadmap *items* — they're process changes worth keeping now
that Phase 0 established them:

1. **CI is now a gate, not a suggestion.** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs
   typecheck + the full harness + a production build on every push and PR.
   The index.html regression (Phase 0) would have been caught on the very
   next push if this had existed. Don't merge to `main`/`Fable-build` with
   CI red.
2. **"Computed but never consulted" is now a known bug shape in this
   codebase**, found twice in one pass (`district.align`/`.trap`/
   `.incumbent`, and `state.tier`). When adding a new field to `GameState`
   or a new gate to a card (`show`/`req`), grep for both "where is this
   written" and "where is this read" before considering it done — Phase 1
   item 2 proposes automating this specific check for the ally/rep/asset
   pattern.
3. **Single source of truth for anything duplicated across a harness and
   the engine.** Phase 0 retired the last three harnesses that
   hand-copied engine logic instead of importing it. Any new harness
   should import `src/engine`/`src/data` directly — never re-derive a
   formula by hand, even for a "quick" standalone script.
4. **Balance changes get a harness guardrail, not just a measurement.**
   `full-campaign.ts` now asserts the money/labor win-rate ratio can't
   silently regress past 2.3x. Future tuning passes on any strategy-vs-
   strategy or persona-vs-persona axis should add a similar assertion, not
   just a one-time printed table that nobody re-checks.
